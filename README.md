# SmallThings
This repo shall provide info about "Small Things". Systems like the rPI, the Jetson Nano, an ESP-32 board or just a RS-485 connector. I am working a lot with these little things - a fascinating part of systems these days. A Jetson Nano provides a lot of oooomph for a low price range. Especially during the first months it seems to be still an time consuming activity to gather related information about system setup, interesting options and scripts or know-how transfer regarding all those powerful frameworks. 
 
Instead of writing down the "lessons learnt" here and there on my local system i want to keep the related info in github for everyone to re-use for a faster start.

Most of the info listed here is based on code snippets, hints and examples from other sources. I try to link to the original sources whenever possible.
