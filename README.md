# SmallThings


This repo shall provide info about "Small Things". Systems like the
rRPi, the Nvidia Jetson Nano, the plethora of available ESP-32 boards or
just a simple RS-485 connector component. I am working a lot with these
little things - a fascinating part of systems these days. A Jetson Nano
provides a lot of oooomph for a low price range for example.

Especially during the first months in existance it seems to be still an
time consuming activity to gather all of the related information about
system setup, interesting options and scripts or any kind of know-how
transfer regarding all those powerful frameworks.
 
Instead of writing down the "lessons learnt" here and there in notebooks
on my local system i want to keep the related info in github for
everyone to re-use for a faster start.

Some of the info listed here is based on code snippets, hints and
examples from other sources. I try to link to the original sources
whenever possible.
