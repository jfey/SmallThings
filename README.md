# SmallThings Notebook

This repo is about "Small Things". Systems like the rRPi, the Nvidia Jetson Nano, the plethora of available ESP-32 boards, Arduino related hardware and code or just a simple RS-485 connector component. I am working a lot with these little things - a fascinating part of the system world these days. A Jetson Nano provides a lot of oooomph for a low price range for example.

Especially during the first months in existence it seems to be still an time consuming activity to gather all of the related information about system setup, interesting options and scripts or any kind of know-how transfer regarding all those powerful frameworks. In addition, some chapters will cover additional sources like language tutorials, sources for deep learning models or interesting conference.
 
Instead of writing down the "lessons learnt" all over the place in notebooks on my local system i want to keep the related info on github for everyone to re-use for a faster start.

This is work in progress. I try to add more and more info as time permits.

**Note**: Some of the info listed here is based on code snippets, hints and examples from other sources. I try to link to the original sources whenever possible.
