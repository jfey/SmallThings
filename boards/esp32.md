# ESP32

The ESP32 - introduced in 2016 - represents many features one might be looking for - starting with a powerful CPU, providing a wide range of I/O including WLAN and BT capabilities. As such it is one of the sweet spots for IoT or general embedded projects even in the year of 2020.

The official development toolchain is the [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). The IDE
A very good introduction into the basic toolchain setup can be found in this article from Hackaday:
