\- Nice backgrounder from the good 'ol DDJ


[TinyFSM](https://digint.ch/tinyfsm/) - TinyFSM is a simple finite state
machine library for C++, designed for optimal performance and low memory
footprint. TinyFSM benefits from the C++11 template metaprogramming features like variadic templates, and does not depend on RTTI, exceptions or any external library.
